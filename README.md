# Beef Noodle Restaurant Website

Purpose:
Beef Noodle Restaurant, situated in my hometown Scarborough, has always been one of my go-to restaurants. I have visited this restaurant countless times and their
signature beef noodle soup holds a special place in my heart (well stomach in this case). This local restaurant served many of my friends, family, and relatives from
all over the world, making this restaurant seem like a part of my family. However, I noticed that they do not have their own website displaying their 
culinary talents and dishes. Despite having Google and Yelp Reviews, I thought it would be nice for them to have their own website to further display their authenticity
and promote the restaurant. With this goal in mind, I created a fan-made website for the restaurant, and aim to have it officially hosted by the restaurant owners this year.
